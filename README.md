Check Requirements file for Lists of Packages used.

This project focuses on training YOLOv8 models in python to detect 40 different classes of military aircraft, as well as an application that overlays the military aircraft classification on any desired video file. 

This repository contains two main files.
The first being the Jupyter NoteBook file showing the steps taken to create the YOLOv8 model, train it on the Militry Aircraft Dataset, and Create an overlay for videos using the model as well.

The second is the Python source code file for the full appplication with user input prompts to use the desired YOLOv8 model weights, and choose a video to overlay with the military aircraft classification results.
